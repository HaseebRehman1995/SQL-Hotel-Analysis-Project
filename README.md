# SQL-Hotel-Analysis-Project

Project Description: Hotel Management System Analysis
This project focuses on advanced SQL queries to analyze and manage a hotel management system. It includes tasks such as identifying the top-rated hotels by country, analyzing guest behavior, tracking room usage, and calculating financial metrics. Key highlights include:

1, Top Performers: Ranking the highest-rated hotels by country and filtering top guests based on spending.
2, Operational Insights: Identifying unreserved rooms, guest nationality matching, and frequently booked room types.
3, Revenue Management: Calculating hotel revenue, adding surcharges, and evaluating price performance.
4, Dynamic Updates: Automating status updates for reservations, room availability, and high-spender identification.
5, Detailed Reporting: Providing percentage-based reservations, room ranking by price, and spending thresholds.
The project combines analytical and operational queries, leveraging SQL features like DENSE_RANK(), JOINs, subqueries, and WITH clauses to deliver actionable insights.
